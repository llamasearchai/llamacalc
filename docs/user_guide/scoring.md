# Scoring Methodology

LlamaCalc evaluates text relevance using a multi-factor approach that analyzes four distinct dimensions of quality. This document explains how each component is calculated and combined into the overall score.

## Score Components

LlamaCalc's evaluation is based on four primary components:

1. **Proximity Score**: How semantically similar the candidate is to the reference
2. **Coverage Score**: How well the candidate covers the key concepts in the reference
3. **Conciseness Score**: How efficiently the candidate presents information
4. **Logical Flow Score**: How well the candidate is structured and coherent

### Proximity Score

The proximity score measures the semantic similarity between the candidate and reference texts.

**Calculation method**:
- Text embeddings are generated for both the candidate and reference texts
- Cosine similarity is calculated between these embeddings
- The result is normalized to a 0-1 scale

**Example**:
```python
from llamacalc.scorers import ProximityScorer

scorer = ProximityScorer()
proximity = scorer.calculate(
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "A brown fox quickly jumped over a dog that was lazy."
)
# Result: ~0.92
```

On Apple Silicon Macs, this calculation uses the MLX framework for faster processing. On other platforms, it uses optimized NumPy operations.

### Coverage Score

The coverage score evaluates how well the candidate text covers the key concepts present in the reference text.

**Calculation method**:
- Key concepts are extracted from the reference text
- Each concept is checked for presence in the candidate text
- The score is calculated as the proportion of reference concepts present in the candidate text
- Advanced semantic matching is used rather than simple string matching

**Example**:
```python
from llamacalc.scorers import CoverageScorer

scorer = CoverageScorer()
coverage = scorer.calculate(
    "Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language.",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language."
)
# Result: ~0.85
```

### Conciseness Score

The conciseness score measures how efficiently the candidate text presents information without unnecessary verbosity.

**Calculation method**:
- The information density of both texts is calculated
- The ratio of essential information to text length is compared
- Redundancies and filler content are penalized
- This is normalized into a 0-1 score

**Example**:
```python
from llamacalc.scorers import ConcisenessScorer

scorer = ConcisenessScorer()
conciseness = scorer.calculate(
    "The meeting will be held on Tuesday at 2 PM in the conference room.",
    "The important meeting that we need to attend will be held at 2 PM on Tuesday in the large conference room on the second floor."
)
# Result: ~0.70
```

### Logical Flow Score

The logical flow score evaluates the structure, coherence, and organization of the candidate text.

**Calculation method**:
- The text is analyzed for logical transitions between sentences and paragraphs
- The presence of a clear introduction, body, and conclusion is evaluated
- The consistency and progression of ideas are assessed
- This is normalized into a 0-1 score

**Example**:
```python
from llamacalc.scorers import LogicalFlowScorer

scorer = LogicalFlowScorer()
logical_flow = scorer.calculate(
    "First, prepare the ingredients. Next, mix them in a bowl. Finally, bake at 350°F for 30 minutes.",
    "Mix ingredients in a bowl. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes."
)
# Result: ~0.85
```

## Combining the Scores

The overall score is a weighted combination of the four component scores:

```
overall_score = (
    proximity_weight * proximity_score +
    coverage_weight * coverage_score +
    conciseness_weight * conciseness_score +
    logical_flow_weight * logical_flow_score
)
```

By default, LlamaCalc assigns equal weights (0.25) to each component, but you can customize these weights based on your specific needs:

```python
from llamacalc import LlamaCalc

# Customize weights to emphasize proximity and coverage
calc = LlamaCalc(
    proximity_weight=0.35,
    coverage_weight=0.35,
    conciseness_weight=0.15,
    logical_flow_weight=0.15
)
```

## Score Interpretation

LlamaCalc produces scores on a scale from 0 to 1, where:

- **0.9 - 1.0**: Exceptional quality, nearly perfect match
- **0.8 - 0.9**: Very high quality, excellent match
- **0.7 - 0.8**: Good quality, strong match
- **0.6 - 0.7**: Acceptable quality, decent match
- **0.5 - 0.6**: Moderate quality, partial match
- **0.4 - 0.5**: Below average, significant mismatch
- **< 0.4**: Poor quality, major mismatch

Remember that these scores are relative and should be used as a comparative tool rather than an absolute measure of quality.

## Advanced Scoring Options

LlamaCalc provides several advanced options for fine-tuning the scoring process:

### Text Preprocessing

You can configure how text is preprocessed before scoring:

```python
from llamacalc import LlamaCalc
from llamacalc.processors import TextProcessor

# Custom text processor
processor = TextProcessor(
    lowercase=True,
    remove_punctuation=True,
    remove_stopwords=True,
    stem_words=False
)

# Use custom processor in LlamaCalc
calc = LlamaCalc(text_processor=processor)
```

### Custom Scorers

For advanced use cases, you can create and use custom scoring components:

```python
from llamacalc import LlamaCalc
from llamacalc.scorers import BaseScorer

class MyCustomScorer(BaseScorer):
    def calculate(self, candidate, reference):
        # Custom scoring logic here
        return score

# Use custom scorer
calc = LlamaCalc(
    custom_scorers=[MyCustomScorer()],
    custom_weights=[0.2]  # Weight for custom scorer
)
```

## Validation and Benchmarks

LlamaCalc's scoring methodology has been validated against human judgments and established benchmarks. Internal testing shows a correlation of 0.85+ with human evaluations on diverse text samples.

The scoring algorithm is continuously refined based on user feedback and new research in natural language understanding.
