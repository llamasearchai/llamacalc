## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment for development:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # For development dependencies
```

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

### Style Guidelines
